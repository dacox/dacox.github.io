My name is Doug Cox. I am a software developer living in Victoria, British Columbia.

I am fascinated by computers and technology, and am powered by great coffee and craft beer. These days I am interested in cryptography, machine learning, and building scalable systems. 

I am currently employed at [Kinsol Research](http://www.kinsolresearch.com) and studied Computer Science at the [University of Victoria](https://www.csc.uvic.ca/).

You can find me online at [Github](https://github.com/dacox) and [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/cscdoug).
